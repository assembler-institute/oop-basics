1.- What is object-oriented programming in general terms?
    Is the most popular programming paradigm , that relies on the concept of classes and objects.
    It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints.
    The four basics of OOP are Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, and Data abstraction.

2.- What is a class?
    A class is a mould based on an element in the real world, which can be used both to create objects and to create other moulds.

3.- What is an object?
    An object in OOP is a product of a class. Software objects are often used to model real-world objects.

4.- What is an instance?
    An specific object of a collection.

5.- What is a property?
    Classes can have variables, those variables are called properties.

6.- What is a method?
    Are functions that are defined inside a class that describe the behaviors of an object.

7.- What is the difference between a function and a method?
    Functions are define outside classes.

8.- What is a constructor?
    Allows you to initialize an object's properties upon creation of the object.
    In constructors, you set the properties of an object when you create it.
    A given house is an instance.

9.- What is the difference between a class, an object and an instance?
    A blueprint for a house design is like a class description.
    All the houses built from that blueprint are objects of that class.

10.- What do we understand about the concept of encapsulation?
    Enclosing the internal details of the object to protect from external sources

11.-What do we understand about the concept of abstraction?
    Is a concept in which a class has methods without implementation. The idea is to have a template and let the child class that inherits the parent class implement the method.

12.-What do we understand about the concept of inheritance?
     When a class is a child of another class. The child class will inherit all the public and protected properties and methods from the parent class.

13.- What do we understand about the concept of polymorphism?
    Is the ability of an object to overwrite methods, whit the same name but doing different things.

14.- What do we understand about the concept of Overload?
    Is the ability of a class to have several methods with the same name and to execute one or the other depending on the parameters passed in the call.

15.-What do we understand about the concept of Override?
    Is the ability of a class to modify one inherit method.

16.- What differences exist between the concept of Overload and Override?
    Overload methods are in the same class.

17.- What is a static class?
    They have methods and variables that can be used without the need to instantiate the class.

18.- Look for 3 advantages over object-oriented programming compared to other programming paradigms
    Reuse of code through inheritance. Dont repeat yourself.
    Effective problem solving, it is better to face many small problems than one big, fat one.
    Security.

19.- Look for disadvantages of this paradigm.
    Learning curve seems steeper than procedural.
    More time, more size, more effort
    Lower performance, compared to procedural programs, OOP systems are much slow.

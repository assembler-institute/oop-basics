# OOP Basics: Valentino Traverso

This is the solution of the OOP PHP pill created by Valentino Traverso.

## Instance super class

```
new Brand('Dealership Name', Bool('Open[true]/Close[false]'), 'Type of vehicle', 'Style of vehicle', 'Type of energy');
```

This is the way be must create the first view of our OOP mode.

Then if you want to use the inherit class to determine a brand and a model of your vehicle, you must do the following:

1- Set the brand and model:
```
->setBrand('Brand', 'Model');
```

2- Set the price:
```
->setPrice(Int(price));
```

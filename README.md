## Theorical part

What is object-oriented programming in general terms?
>Object-oriented programming combines a group of data attributes 
with functions or methods into a unit called an "object."

What is a class?
>a class is a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values like methods, or attributes

What is an object?
> An object is an instance of a particular class


What is an instance?
>an instance is a concrete occurrence of any object, existing usually during the runtime of a program, the best example i'ts with cars, The class is Cars, and a instance is "Peugeot 406"

What is a property?
>Properties are characteristics or attributes of an object. An example of an object is a person. A person will have attributes such as name, gender, age, height, and weight. 


What is a method?
>Methods are functions of a class


What is the difference between a function and a method?
> A function is a piece of code that is called by name. It can be passed data to operate on (i.e. the parameters) and can optionally return data (the return value). A method is a piece of code that is called by a name that is associated with an object.

What is a constructor?
>is a special type of subroutine called to create an object. It prepares the new object for use, often accepting arguments that the constructor uses to set required member variables

What is the difference between a class, an object and an instance?
> A class contains attributes, after, with these attr, we can instance a variable, that variable will convert into an object.

What do we understand about the concept of encapsulation?
> The encapsulation it's a type of visibility in OOP, and it have 3 options, public (all can access), private (only own class can access) and protected (class owner and sons can access to this encapulation level).

What do we understand about the concept of abstraction?
>An abstraction is a template, this template will give way to other classes that can inherit its properties and methods. 

What do we understand about the concept of inheritance?
> This concept takes sense when we try to create similar classes, with same attributes, to simplify this, we can inherit classes to each others. This will save us a few lines of code.

What do we understand about the concept of polymorphism?
>it describes the concept that you can access objects of different types through the same interface.

What do we understand about the concept of Overload?
>Method overloading is a form of polymorphism in OOP. ... Overloading happens when you have two methods with the same name but different signatures (or arguments).

What do we understand about the concept of Override?
>Overriding is a feature that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its super-classes or parent classes.

What differences exist between the concept of Overload and Override?
>Overriding means, giving a different definition of an existing function with same parameters, and overloading means adding a different definition of an existing function with different parameters.

What is a static class?
>A static class basically boils down to a class which can only have a single object implement it

Look for 3 advantages over object-oriented programming compared to other programming paradigms
- Improved productivity: we can reuse code in an easy way and code faster
- High abstraction level: focused on the functionalities not in the code
- Rich encapsulation: makes secure and easy to maintain code

Look for disadvantages of this paradigm.
- Steep learning curve: may take time to get used to it
- Larger program size
- Slower programs

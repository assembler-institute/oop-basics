What is object-oriented programming in general terms?
- OOP is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data or objects. Once an object is known, it is labeled with a class of objects that defines the kind of data it contains and any logic sequences that can manipulate it.

What is a class?
-  The class is a blueprint that defines a nature of a future object.

What is an object?
- Object is an instance of class by which we can access the data members and member functions of the class.

What is an instance?
- An object may be varied in a number of ways. Each realized variation of that object is an instance.

What is a property?
- Properties are attributes or features that characterize classes.

What is a method?
- Methods are functions that belongs to the class. Methods are functions attached to specific classes (or instances).

What is the difference between a function and a method?
- Function is a set of logic that can be used to manipulate data. While, Method is function that is used to manipulate the data of the object where it belongs. A method is a procedure or function in OOP. Whereas, a function is a group of reusable code which can be used anywhere in the program.

What is a constructor?
- A properly written constructor leaves the resulting object in a valid state. ... Immutable objects must be initialized in a constructor.

What is the difference between a class, an object and an instance?
-

What do we understand about the concept of encapsulation?
- Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data, along with the methods that operate on that data, into a single unit.

What do we understand about the concept of abstraction?
- Objects in an OOP language provide an abstraction that hides the internal implementation details. Similar to the coffee machine in your kitchen, you just need to know which methods of the object are available to call and which input parameters are needed to trigger a specific operation. But you donâ€™t need to understand how this method is implemented and which kinds of actions it has to perform to create the expected result. (I like the example)

What do we understand about the concept of inheritance?
- Inheritance is the procedure in which one class inherits the attributes and methods of another class.

What do we understand about the concept of polymorphism?
- Describes situations in which something occurs in several different forms. In computer science, it describes the concept that you can access objects of different types through the same interface.

What do we understand about the concept of Overload?
- Overloading occurs when two or more methods in one class have the same method name but different parameters.

What do we understand about the concept of Override?
- Overriding occurs when two methods have the same method name and parameters.

What differences exist between the concept of Overload and Override?
- Overloading is when you have the same function name that takes different parameters. Overriding is when a child class replaces a parent's method with one of its own

What is a static class?
-We can declare a class static by using the static keyword. A class can be declared static only if it is a nested class. It does not require any reference of the outer class. The property of the static class is that it does not allows us to access the non-static members of the outer class.

Look for 3 advantages over object-oriented programming compared to other programming paradigms
- Security, the other programmers understand more the code and Code Reusability

Look for disadvantages of this paradigm.
- It can be inefficient, It can be too scalable and It can cause duplication.

In this project the basic concepts of OOP have been implemented with concept examples for Inheritance, Abstraction, Polymorphism, Interfaces, Class Properties, Constructor Methods, Overload, Override and Access Modifiers.

## Prerequisites

Before we can get started you will need to make sure that all the necessary dependencies are installed in your system.

### PHP 

You can install it by following the instructions [in the official docs](https://www.php.net/downloads) (we recommend that you install the version that is named _Current_).

To verify that you have installed it correctly, you can run the following command from the terminal that should output the version installed:

```bash
$ php -version
```

In the event that you prefer to use a tool that installs everything you need to configure and run a PHP server, we recommend using [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/es/download.html)

### XAMPP 

XAMPP is a completely free and easy to install Apache distribution that contains MariaDB, PHP, and Perl. The XAMPP installation package has been designed to be incredibly easy to install and use.

You have to go to the [download page](https://www.apachefriends.org/es/download.html) and it will automatically recommend installing the latest version available.

Once downloaded and installed, in the case that the Windows operating system you will see the following screen, in which you will only have to start the Apache service.

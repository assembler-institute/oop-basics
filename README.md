# OOP-Basics

In the paradigm of object-oriented programming, there are many mechanisms that allow us to carry out the design of our software to be solid and scalable. Classes, Properties, Herency, Interface Polymorphism, Constructor and Destructors. Let’s take a look at all of this.

## What are the main objectives in this project?

● Improve your knowledge in object-oriented programming.

● Understand Herency.

● Understand how to use Abstraction.

● Understand what is Polymorphism.

● Understand what interfaces are and what they are used for.

## Theoretical part

● What is object-oriented programming in general terms?

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. ... OOP focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them.

● What is a class?

In object-oriented programming, a class is an extensible program-code-template for creating objects, providing initial values for state (member variables) and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).

● What is an object?

In object-oriented programming (OOP), objects are the things you think about first in designing a program and they are also the units of code that are eventually derived from the process. ... Each object is an instance of a particular class or subclass with the class's own methods or procedures and data variables.

● What is an instance?

In object-oriented programming (OOP), an instance is a concrete occurrence of any object, existing usually during the runtime of a computer program. ... The creation of an instance is called instantiation. An object may be varied in a number of ways. Each realized variation of that object is an instance of its class.

● What is a property?

A property, in some object-oriented programming languages, is a special sort of class member, intermediate in functionality between a field (or data member) and a method.

● What is a method?

A method in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a procedure associated with a message and an object. ... This allows the sending objects to invoke behaviors and to delegate the implementation of those behaviors to the receiving object. A method in PHP programming sets the behavior of a class object.

● What is the difference between a function and a method?

Method and a function are the same, with different terms. A method is a procedure or function in object-oriented programming. A function is a group of reusable code which can be called anywhere in your program. This eliminates the need for writing the same code again and again

● What is a constructor?

In class-based object-oriented programming, a constructor (abbreviation: ctor) is a special type of subroutine called to create an object. It prepares the new object for use, often accepting arguments that the constructor uses to set required member variables. ... Immutable objects must be initialized in a constructor.

● What is the difference between a class, an object and an instance?

A class is a blueprint which you use to create objects. An object is an instance of a class - it's a concrete 'thing' that you made using a specific class. So, 'object' and 'instance' are the same thing, but the word 'instance' indicates the relationship of an object to its class.

● What do we understand about the concept of encapsulation?

Encapsulation in OOP Meaning: In object-oriented computer programming languages, the notion of encapsulation (or OOP Encapsulation) refers to the bundling of data, along with the methods that operate on that data, into a single unit. Many programming languages use encapsulation frequently in the form of classes.

● What do we understand about the concept of abstraction?

Abstraction is the concept of object-oriented programming that "shows" only essential attributes and "hides" unnecessary information. The main purpose of abstraction is hiding the unnecessary details from the users. ... It is one of the most important concepts of OOPs.

● What do we understand about the concept of inheritance?

Inheritance is the procedure in which one class inherits the attributes and methods of another class. The class whose properties and methods are inherited is known as the Parent class. And the class that inherits the properties from the parent class is the Child class.

● What do we understand about the concept of polymorphism?

Polymorphism is the ability of any data to be processed in more than one form. ... Polymorphism is one of the most important concept of object oriented programming language. The most common use of polymorphism in object-oriented programming occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.

● What do we understand about the concept of Overload?

Overloading. Method overloading is a form of polymorphism in OOP. ... Overloading happens when you have two methods with the same name but different signatures (or arguments). In a class we can implement two or more methods with the same name.

● What do we understand about the concept of Override?

In any object-oriented programming language, Overriding is a feature that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its super-classes or parent classes.

● What differences exist between the concept of Overload and Override?

The most basic difference is that overloading is being done in the same class while for overriding base and child classes are required. Overriding is all about giving a specific implementation to the inherited method of parent class. ... private and final methods can be overloaded but they cannot be overridden.

● What is a static class?

A static class in PHP is a type of class which is instantiated only once in a program. It must contain a static member (variable) or a static member function (method) or both. The variables and methods are accessed without the creation of an object, using the scope resolution operator(::).

● Look for 3 advantages over object-oriented programming compared to other programming paradigms

Improved productivity: we can reuse code in an easy way and code faster.

High abstraction level: focused on the functionalities not in the code.

Rich encapsulation: makes secure and easy to maintain code.

● Look for disadvantages of this paradigm.

Steep learning curve: may take time to get used to it.

Larger program size.

Slower programs.

## Requeriments

Your practical OOP example must accomplish this requirements:

● Base class that will be inherited at least once.

    ○	This base case must have at least:

        ■	3 properties

        ■	3 methods

        ■	1 constructor and 1 destructor

● One class that inherits the base class.

    ○	This class must add:

        ■	1 static property

        ■	1 method

    ○	This class must override:

        ■	1 property

        ■	1 method

● One abstract class with at least:

    ○	2 properties

    ○	2 methods

● One interface that must be implemented by one class.

    ○	This interface must have at least 2 methods.

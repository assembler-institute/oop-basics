### The repo <!-- omit in toc -->

First, you will need to clone the repo:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/assembler-school/oop-basics.git
```

### Wireframes <!-- omit in toc -->

- Documents folder:

    - Scheme class: Document with a wireframe of the pill.
## Dependencies

Before we can get started you will need to make sure that all the necessary dependencies are installed in your system.

### PHP <!-- omit in toc -->

You can install it by following the instructions [in the official docs](https://www.php.net/downloads) (we recommend that you install the version that is named _Current_).

To verify that you have installed it correctly, you can run the following command from the terminal that should output the version installed:

```bash
$ php -version
```

## Tools

In the event that you prefer to use a tool that installs everything you need to configure and run a PHP server, we recommend using [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/es/download.html)


## OOP Introduction

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).

## Project files

### [01 - Base Class](./Pill/01-base-class.php01-base-class.php) <!-- omit in toc -->

The OOP paradigm encapsulates concepts of the real world in what is called as Classes which create Objects. In this file you will learn how to create a class and implement methods. 

### [02 - Inherit class](./Pill/02-inherit-class.php) <!-- omit in toc -->

The child class will inherit all the public and protected properties and methods from the parent class. In addition, it can have its own properties and methods. In this file you will learn how to apply the inheritance in your code.

### [03 - Abstract class](./Pill/03-abstract-class.php) <!-- omit in toc -->

Abstract classes and methods are when the parent class has a named method, but need its child class(es) to fill out the tasks. In this file you will learn how to create and use abstract classes.

### [04 - Interfaces](./Pill/04-interface.php) <!-- omit in toc -->

Interfaces allow you to specify what methods a class should implement.
Interfaces make it easy to use a variety of different classes in the same way. When one or more classes use the same interface, it is referred to as "polymorphism". In this file you will learn how to create and extend interfaces.

### [Index](./Pill/index.php) <!-- omit in toc -->

In this document you will find all the instances of the pill.
